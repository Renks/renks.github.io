                        Guild Wars 2 is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by ArenaNet and published by NCSoft and ArenaNet. Set in the fantasy world of Tyria, the game follows the re-emergence of Destiny's Edge, a disbanded guild dedicated to fighting the Elder Dragons, a Lovecraftian species that has seized control of Tyria in the time since the original Guild Wars. The game takes place in a persistent world with a story that progresses in instanced environments.[2]

                        Guild Wars 2 claims to be unique in the genre[3] by featuring a storyline that is responsive to player actions,[4] something which is common in single player role-playing games but rarely seen in multiplayer ones. A dynamic event system replaces traditional questing,[5] utilising the ripple effect to allow players to approach quests in different ways as part of a persistent world. Also of note is the combat system, which aims to be more dynamic than its predecessor by promoting synergy between professions and using the environment as a weapon,[6][7] as well as reducing the complexity of the Magic-style skill system of the original game.
                        
                        As a sequel to Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 features the same lack of subscription fees that distinguished its predecessor from other commercially developed online games of the time, though until August 2015 a purchase was still required to install the game.[8] The game sold over two million copies in its first two weeks.[9][10] By August 2013, the peak player concurrency had reached 460,000.[11] By August 2015, over 5 million copies had been sold, at which point the base game became free-to-play.[12]
